description: Maison GR method for reviewing code for security vulnerabilities. Use when asked for a security review or audit, and when a change touches authentication, authorisation, sessions, user input handling, file uploads, payments, personal data, secrets, cryptography, third-party integrations, dependencies, or AI features that process untrusted content.

# Maison GR Security Review

## Objective

Find vulnerabilities an attacker could realistically exploit, prove each one with a concrete attack path, and recommend the smallest fix. Report fewer, verified findings rather than a long list of theoretical ones.

## When to use

- An explicit security review or audit.
- Changes to login, sessions, tokens, permissions or roles.
- New endpoints, forms, file uploads, webhooks or integrations.
- Code handling payments, personal data, health data or credentials.
- LLM or agent features that read untrusted content or can call tools.

For general code quality, use the code review skill instead.

## Method

### 1. Model the threat

Before reading code line by line, answer:

- **Assets:** what is worth protecting? Accounts, money, personal data, admin powers, secrets.
- **Actors:** anonymous visitor, signed-in user, user of another tenant, administrator, compromised dependency.
- **Entry points:** every place untrusted data enters: HTTP parameters, headers, cookies, uploaded files, webhooks, queue messages, environment, files the app reads, content fed to an LLM.
- **Trust boundaries:** where data crosses from less trusted to more trusted code.

### 2. Trace untrusted data

For each entry point, follow the data to where it is used, and check the sink:

| Sink | Risk | Expected control |
|---|---|---|
| SQL or NoSQL query | Injection | Parameterised queries; no string-built queries or operator objects from input |
| Shell command | Command injection | No shell; argument arrays; allow-listed values |
| File path | Path traversal | Resolve and confirm the path stays inside an allowed root |
| HTML output | Cross-site scripting | Framework auto-escaping; no raw HTML from input; sanitiser where HTML is required |
| Outbound request URL | Server-side request forgery | Allow-list hosts; block internal address ranges |
| Redirect target | Open redirect | Relative paths or allow-listed hosts only |
| Deserialiser or template engine | Code execution | No untrusted input to unsafe deserialisers or template compilation |
| LLM prompt with tool access | Prompt injection | Treat content as data; restrict tools; require confirmation for consequential actions |

### 3. Check access control

Broken access control is the most common serious flaw. For every protected operation:

- Is the user authenticated?
- Is the user authorised for **this specific resource**? Look up the record and check its owner or tenant, not just the user's role.
- Is the check on the server, on every path to the operation (API, background job, export, admin tool)?
- Can a user change an identifier in the request to reach another user's data?
- Can a user set fields they should not, such as `role`, `price` or `ownerId`, through mass assignment?

### 4. Check authentication and sessions

- Passwords hashed with a slow algorithm designed for passwords (Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt).
- Rate limiting or lockout on login, password reset and verification codes.
- Session cookies `HttpOnly`, `Secure` and `SameSite`; sessions rotated at login and invalidated at logout.
- Tokens verified for signature, expiry, audience and issuer. No `alg: none`.
- Password reset tokens single-use, short-lived and not leaked in logs or referrers.

### 5. Check data exposure and secrets

- Responses return only the fields the client needs. No password hashes, internal flags or other users' data.
- Logs and error messages contain no secrets, tokens or unnecessary personal data. Stack traces are not shown to users.
- Secrets come from the environment or a secret manager, never from the repository. Search the diff and history for keys.
- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit, and at rest where the project requires it.

### 6. Check configuration and dependencies

- Security headers and CORS: no wildcard origin combined with credentials.
- CSRF protection on state-changing requests that rely on cookies.
- Debug modes and verbose errors are disabled in production configuration.
- Dependencies: run the ecosystem's audit tool (`npm audit`, `pnpm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, `govulncheck`) and report known vulnerabilities that are reachable.

### 7. Verify each finding

For every candidate finding, write the attack path: who sends what, through which entry point, to reach which impact. Check that no upstream control already blocks it. If you can safely demonstrate it in a local or test environment, do so. Never test against production or third-party systems without written authorisation.

## Severity

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Critical** | Remote, unauthenticated compromise of data or systems |
| **High** | Authenticated user can reach other users' data or escalate privileges |
| **Medium** | Exploitable with conditions, or limited impact |
| **Low** | Defence-in-depth gap without a direct exploit |

## Constraints

- Report only what you can support with an attack path. Label anything else as a hardening suggestion.
- Do not print real secrets you find; give their location and recommend rotation.
- Do not run destructive tests, scans against systems you do not own, or exploit code against shared environments.

## Verification

- [ ] Entry points and trust boundaries were listed.
- [ ] Every protected operation was checked for object-level authorisation.
- [ ] Each finding has an attack path and a severity.
- [ ] The dependency audit was run, or the report says why not.

## Output

```text
[High] Insecure direct object reference — GET /api/invoices/:id
Attack: signed-in user A requests /api/invoices/<id of user B's invoice>.
Impact: any user can read any invoice, including customer addresses.
Evidence: handler loads the invoice by id without checking ownerId (src/routes/invoices.ts:42).
Fix: load with { id, ownerId: session.userId } and return 404 when missing.
```

End with the scope reviewed, what was out of scope, and any hardening suggestions separated from findings.
