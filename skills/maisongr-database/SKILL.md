# Maison GR Database Engineering

## Objective

Change data structures and queries without losing data, breaking running code, or locking production. The database outlives every application version that talks to it.

## When to use

- Designing or changing tables, collections, columns, fields, constraints or indexes.
- Writing migrations, backfills or one-off data fixes.
- Writing or optimising queries.
- Reviewing changes that do any of the above.

## Method

### 1. Learn the current state

- Find the schema source of truth: migration files, ORM schema, or the live schema via the project's tooling.
- Find the migration tool and its commands: create, apply, roll back, status.
- Identify which environment you are connected to before running anything. Check the connection string or database name. Never assume a local command targets a local database.
- Read the existing constraints, indexes and naming conventions.

### 2. Model the data

- Put integrity rules in the database where the engine supports them: `NOT NULL`, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints. Application validation alone does not protect data written by other code paths.
- Choose types that match the data: timestamps with time zones, exact decimals for money, enums or check constraints for fixed sets.
- Name things consistently with the existing schema.
- In document stores, enforce the schema in one place (validator or ODM schema) and decide explicitly between embedding and referencing based on access patterns.

### 3. Plan the migration for a running system

Assume old and new application versions run at the same time during deploys. Use expand and contract:

1. **Expand:** add the new column, table or index in a backward-compatible way (nullable, or with a default).
2. **Migrate code:** deploy code that writes to both or reads from the new structure with a fallback.
3. **Backfill:** move existing data in batches.
4. **Contract:** once nothing uses the old structure, remove it in a later migration.

Never rename or drop a column that deployed code still reads, in the same release.

### 4. Make migrations safe

- Each migration is reversible, or its irreversibility is stated and approved.
- On large tables, avoid operations that rewrite the table or hold long locks. Use the engine's online options, such as `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` in PostgreSQL.
- Batch backfills and make them resumable and idempotent.
- Never edit a migration that has already run in a shared environment. Write a new one.
- Keep schema migrations and large data migrations separate.

### 5. Write correct queries

- Parameterise every value. Never build queries by concatenating input.
- Use a transaction when several writes must succeed or fail together. Keep transactions short.
- Watch for N+1 queries in loops; fetch related data in one query or a batched one.
- Select the columns you need, and paginate unbounded results.
- Handle concurrency explicitly: unique constraints, conditional updates or row locks, not check-then-write.

### 6. Measure performance

- Read the query plan (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL, `.explain()` in MongoDB) before and after adding an index.
- Add indexes for real query patterns, matching column order to filters and sort order. Every index slows writes and uses space.

## Constraints

- Never run destructive statements (`DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE` or `UPDATE` without a narrow `WHERE`) against a shared or production database without explicit approval and a verified backup.
- Never point development tooling at production data unless the developer confirms it is intended.
- Do not disable constraints or triggers to make a migration pass.
- Do not log query parameters that contain personal data or secrets.

## Verification

- [ ] The target environment was confirmed before running anything.
- [ ] The migration applies cleanly on a fresh database and on a copy of current data where possible.
- [ ] The rollback was run, or its absence is approved.
- [ ] Old and new application versions both work during the transition.
- [ ] Query plans were checked for new or changed hot queries.

## Output

Describe the schema change, the migration steps and their order across releases, the rollback path, lock and performance risks, and the verification performed.
